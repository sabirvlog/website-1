               <p class="right-para"> 
                API is a set of rules and definitions that allow different clients, software, or services to communicate with each other over the internet. When two systems communicate, the server is the one that provides the API, and the client is the one who consumes it.
                APIs take a request from the client or user and send it to the server, which then sends back a response based on the request.
                This communication is done through HTTP methods such as:
                GET: used to retrieve a resource.
                DELETE: used to delete a resource.
                PUT: used to replace an existing resource.
                POST: used to create a new resource.
